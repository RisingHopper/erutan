            Some people may find it boring to read a paragraph with too much text and The erutan knows that this is not encouraging, so a way has been sought that allows people to learn and have fun at the same time.<br>
            This idea is inspired by a YouTube channel called WATOP (We Are Top), which makes videos with a theme similar to what the project aims to achieve.
            Through this channel, it has become aware that the message must be striking (that manages to capture the attention of visitors) and concise (clear and direct) so that it lasts in the memory of the person. In other words, the message must have an impact on the person so that they cannot forget the information that has been transmitted to them.",
